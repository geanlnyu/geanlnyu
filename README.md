## Hi there 👋

I'm Gean, a Software QA based in the Philippines.

I'm on a mission to find every bug on the internet, one URL at a time. 

My core automation stack features Cypress, Playwright, and JavaScript, complemented by a working knowledge of Python. 

Beyond the code, I rely on a suite of documentation and project management tools, including Jira, Confluence, and Lark Base, as well as the Microsoft Office ecosystem.

As a Hybrid QA Engineer, I balance the efficiency of automated frameworks with the critical eye of manual testing.
